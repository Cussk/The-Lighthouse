This project takes all the principles taught in both the Junior Programmer and Creative Core learning pathways through Unity.  It is a first-person puzzle/walking simulator level built from the ground up using art assets from Unity's Asset Store and assets provided in learning path courses.  Initially graybox porotype taken to complete level.  All the scripts were written with C#.

First person movement and camera control with mouse scripted.  Cursor lock and unlock with Escape key to interact with UI for game exit and restart.  Animation control on key press.  Simple puzzle logic.  UI control through script.  Scene transition and application exit with buttons controlled by script.

Custom materials and shaders as well as Asset store versions used for object design.  Lighting implemented in realtime for spot, point and directional lighting.  Animations created from key frames for rotation and transformation.  Custom and imported VFX and audio used for improved immersion.  Post-processing added to set tone of level.  Ui added to tell simple story through cues, items held denoted by image, menu buttons added for scene transition and control.
